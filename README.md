# üìä Financial Dashboard in Power BI
## üîπ Problem Statement
The finance team of a company is facing challenges in tracking and analyzing financial performance across multiple components and time periods. Currently, reports are generated manually using Excel, leading to:
- ‚è≥ Delayed decision-making due to slow reporting cycles.  
- üìâ Difficulty in comparing actual vs. target performance for Income, Expenses, and Savings.  
- üîç Lack of visibility into trends such as Monthly, Quarterly, and Yearly growth.  
- üìä Inefficient tracking of KPIs like **Gross Margin %, Operating Income, and Savings**.  
To overcome these challenges, the company required a **centralized, interactive financial dashboard built in Power BI**.

## üîπ Dataset Description
The dataset was sourced from **Excel spreadsheets** containing financial transactions and targets.  

**Dataset Fields:**  
- **Type**: Expense, Saving, Income, Target  
- **Components**: Emergency Fund, EMI, Fixed Deposit, Freelancing, Groceries & Food, Health, House Rent, Leisure, Liquid Cash, Mutual Fund, Salary, Savings, Shopping, Travel, Other  
- **Date**  
- **Value**  
- **Year**  
- **Month-Year**
- 
## üîπ Data Modeling Steps
### 1. Data Collection & Preparation
- Imported financial data (Expense, Saving, Income, Target) from Excel.  
- Cleaned and transformed data using **Power Query**.  

### 2. Data Modeling
- Created relationships to enable time intelligence analysis.  

### 3. DAX Calculations
- Developed calculated measures including:  
  - **Total Value**  
  - **Income, Expense, Savings, Savings %**  
  - **Monthly Growth for Income, Expense, Savings**  
  - **Income Change MoM %**  
  - **Time Intelligence (e.g., PREVIOUSMONTH)**  

## üîπ DAX Measures Used
Examples of DAX measures implemented:  

```DAX
Total Value = SUM('Dataset'[Value])

Income = CALCULATE([Total Value], 'Dataset'[Type] = "Income")

Expense = CALCULATE([Total Value], 'Dataset'[Type] = "Expense")

Savings = CALCULATE([Total Value], 'Dataset'[Type] = "Savings")

Saving % = DIVIDE([Savings], [Income])

Income LM = CALCULATE([Income], DATEADD('Dataset'[Date].[Date],-1, Month))

Income Change MoM % = DIVIDE([Income], [Income LM])

Income_Monthly_Growth = VAR Val = (CALCULATE([Monthly_Growth],'Dataset'[Type] = "Income" )) RETURN IF(Val=BLANK(), 0, Val)

Monthly Sale = Var CY_Selected_Month = SELECTEDVALUE('Selected Date'[Month_Year]) Return CALCULATE ([Total Value],'Dataset'[Month_Year] = CY_Selected_Month)

PY_Month_Sale = Var PY_Month =  PREVIOUSMONTH('Selected Date'[Date]) RETURN CALCULATE([Total Value], 'Dataset'[Date] = PY_Month)

Monthly_Growth = DIVIDE([Monthly Sale] - [PY_Month_Sale], [PY_Month_Sale])

##üîπ** Dashboard Explanation**
